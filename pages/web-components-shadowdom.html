<h2>The Shadow DOM</h2>
<p>
  The Shadow DOM is a web standard that allows developers to encapsulate a part of the DOM and CSS styles, creating a separate, isolated scope for a component. 
  This means that styles defined within the shadow DOM do not affect the main document and vice versa, which helps in avoiding style conflicts and enhances modularity in web development.
  This also applies to functionality, as scripts operating outside of the shadow DOM will not directly affect elements within it.
</p>
<p>
  A shadow DOM can be attached to any HTML element, but it is most useful for custom elements.
  To attach a shadow DOM to an element, call the <code>attachShadow</code> method on the element to create a new root.
  <code-sample language="javascript"><template>
    export default
    /**
     * A simple web component that uses Shadow DOM.
     * This component creates a shadow root and adds some content to it.
     */
    class MyWebComponent extends HTMLElement {
      constructor() {
        super();
        // Create a shadow root
        this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
        // Add some content to the shadow DOM
        this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
          <style>
            p { color: blue; }
          </style>
          <p>This is inside the shadow DOM!</p>
        `;
      }
    }
  </template></code-sample>
</p>
<p>
  Of course, a web component doesn't need to attach a shadow DOM and only needs to do so for isolation from the surrounding DOM.
  For example, a navigation component may not want to prevent its anchor elements from being styled with the rest of the document.
  This is as simple as adding anchor elements into the custom element and <em>not</em> attaching a shadowDOM.
  <code-sample language="html"><template>
    <custom-nav-component>
      <a href="path/to/location-1">Location 1</a>
      <a href="path/to/location-2">Location 2</a>
      <a href="path/to/location-3">Location 3</a>
    </custom-nav-component>
  </template></code-sample>
