<h2>Laser Engraving: Getting the right burn</h2>
<p>
  For this, I am using the
  <a href="https://www.snapmaker.com/en-US/snapmaker-artisan" target="_blank">Snapmaker Artisan</a>
  with the basic 10W laser module.
  I am burning on to what is only described as <em>"Natural Wood"</em> on Amazon.
  It is a light colored wood with a fine grain that stains well and that's about it.
  I use it for making coasters.

  Finding the right burn has been a good deal of trial and error.
  To start, I needed to decide how dark and how deep I wanted the burn to be.
  I have seen a lot of engravings that seem to lightly toast the wood,
  sometimes so lightly that it is either hard to see or wears off over time.

  I really like the darker burns that leave a rich color,
  and I like to be able to feel the engraving with my fingers.
