<h1>React & Typescript Are Obsolete!</h1>
<p>
  It's controversial, I know, but hear me out.
  I'm not saying React is bad, or that Typescript did not serve a purpose.
  I am saying that, like JQUERY, the modern web landscape has evolved and surpassed the need for these technologies.
</p>
<p>
  I'm not just picking on React and Typescript either.
  Most frameworks can be discarded in favor of simpler solutions with less bloat, complexity, and overhead.
  Unfortunately trends like JQuery, React, and Typescript have become so entrenched that it is difficult to convince developers to move on.
</p>
<p>
  And what's the motivation to move on?
  Most of the developers in the wild know one way to make a web app and have never even heard of modern web standards like Web Components.
  The irony is that the patterns that drive React are the same patterns that Web Components use.
  The difference is that React codebases only work with other React codebases, while Web Components can be used anywhere and are far less-likely to become obsolete.
